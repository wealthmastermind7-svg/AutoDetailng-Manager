Perfect. Based on **BookFlow’s actual feature set** and what you just confirmed, here is a **clean, App-Store-safe monetisation design** that mirrors ZOZOFIT’s strategy but is **purpose-built for booking software**.

I will structure this so you can hand it directly to implementation.

---

## 1. Define the Core Premium Value (Very Important)

For BookFlow, the **true premium value is not “booking”**.
It is **distribution and growth**.

Your strongest premium levers are:

1. **Unlimited customer acquisition**

   * Booking links
   * QR codes
   * Website embeds

2. **Professional positioning**

   * Embedded booking on their own website
   * No artificial limits

This is exactly what Apple expects a Business app to monetise.

---

## 2. Free vs Premium Rules (Clear and Defensible)

### Free Plan (Default)

Designed to prove value but introduce friction.

* ✅ Unlimited bookings
* ✅ Admin dashboard
* ✅ Calendar and services
* ✅ Customer management
* ⚠️ **Booking link shares limited to 5 per week**
* ⚠️ **QR code generation limited to 5 per week**
* ❌ Website embeds locked

This feels fair, not punitive.

---

### Premium Plan ($9.99 / month)

Removes friction at growth points.

* ✅ Unlimited booking link shares
* ✅ Unlimited QR codes
* ✅ Website embed widgets (all variants)
* ✅ Priority future features (later)
* ✅ Professional credibility

This is a **clear upgrade**, not a vague “Pro”.

## 3. Exact Paywall Triggers (Screen by Screen)

### Trigger 1: Share Booking Link (Hard Limit)

**Condition:**
User taps “Share Booking Link” for the 6th time in a week.

**Action:**
Block → Modal paywall.

**Copy example:**

> You’ve reached your weekly sharing limit
> Upgrade to share booking links without limits.

CTA:

> Go Premium – $9.99 / month

---

### Trigger 2: Generate QR Code (Hard Limit)

**Condition:**
User tries to generate a 6th QR code in a week.

**Action:**
Block → Modal paywall.

**Copy example:**

> QR codes help customers book instantly
> Unlock unlimited QR codes with Premium.

---

### Trigger 3: Website Embed (Always Premium)

**Condition:**
User taps “Embed on Website”.

**Action:**
Always show paywall first.

**Copy example:**

> Take bookings directly from your website
> Website embeds are available on Premium.

This is a **high-intent moment**.

---

### Trigger 4: Dashboard Soft Reminder

**Condition:**
Dashboard load, once per session.

**Action:**
Non-blocking card or banner.

**Text:**

> Grow faster with unlimited booking links and website embeds.

CTA:

> Unlock Premium

Dismissible. No friction.

---

### Trigger 5: Exit / Close Action

**Condition:**
User closes a share or embed modal.

**Action:**
Soft paywall.

**Text:**

> Less admin. More bookings.
> One simple plan at $9.99/month.

---

## 4. Paywall Copy (BookFlow-Specific)

### Primary Paywall (Distribution-Focused)

**Headline:**
More Bookings.
Less Friction.

**Subtext:**
Share booking links freely, generate unlimited QR codes, and embed booking on your website.

**Price:**
$9.99 / month
*Prices shown in USD. Regional pricing may vary.*

**CTA:**
Go Premium

---

### Secondary Paywall (Limit Reached)

**Headline:**
You’ve Hit Your Weekly Limit

**Subtext:**
Upgrade to remove limits and keep customers booking without interruptions.

**CTA:**
Unlock Premium – $9.99 / month

---

## 5. Why This Will Pass App Review

Apple is fine with this because:

* Core booking still works for free
* Limits are transparent and fair
* No deceptive UI
* Paywalls appear at **logical business moments**
* Subscription benefits are clear and truthful

This is **textbook Business-category monetisation**.

---

## 6. RevenueCat-Ready Product Structure

### Products

* `bookflow_premium_monthly` → $9.99
* Optional later:

  * `bookflow_premium_annual` → $79.99 (optional)

### Entitlement

* `premium_access`

### Feature Flags

* `can_share_booking_link`
* `can_generate_qr`
* `can_use_embeds`

---

## 7. Final Recommendation (Strategic)

This model:

* Monetises **growth**, not usage
* Avoids punishing small businesses
* Scales cleanly from freelancers to agencies
* Feels professional, not gimmicky

It is **exactly the right approach** for BookFlow.
