# Notifications

_A library that provides an API to fetch push notification tokens and to present, schedule, receive and respond to notifications._

Available on platforms android (device-only), ios (device-only)

`expo-notifications` provides an API to fetch push notification tokens and to present, schedule, receive and respond to notifications.

[Notification guides](https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/overview/)

> **warning** Push notifications (remote notifications) functionality provided by `expo-notifications` is unavailable in Expo Go on Android from SDK 53. A [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/) is required to use push notifications. Local notifications (in-app notifications) remain available in Expo Go.

## Features

- Schedule a one-off notification for a specific date or some time from now
- Schedule a notification repeating in some time interval (or a calendar date match on iOS)
- Get and set the application badge icon number
- Obtain a native device push token, so you can send push notifications with FCM (for Android) and APNs (for iOS)
- Obtain an Expo push token, so you can send push notifications with [Expo Push Service](https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/sending-notifications/)
- Listen to incoming notifications in the foreground and background
- Listen to interactions with notifications
- Handle notifications when the app is in the foreground
- Imperatively dismiss notifications from Notification Center/tray
- Create, update, and delete [Android notification channels](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/notifications/channels)
- Set custom icon and color for notifications on Android

## Installation

```bash
$ npx expo install expo-notifications
```

If you are installing this in an existing React Native app, make sure to install `expo` in your project.

<br />
Then proceed to [configuration](#configuration) to set up the [config plugin](#app-config) and
obtain the [credentials](#credentials) for push notifications.

### Known issues <PlatformTags platforms={['android']} />

When launching the app from a push notification in **Android development builds**, the splash screen may fail to display correctly about 70% of the time. The icon and fade animation may not appear as expected.

- Icon may be missing
- Fade animation may not run
- Only the background color may flash briefly

This issue only affects debug builds and does not occur in release builds. To workaround it, test notification launches in release mode (`npx expo run:android --variant release`) for accurate behavior.

## Usage

Check out the example Snack below to see Notifications in action, make sure to use a physical device to test it. Push notifications don't work on emulators/simulators.

```tsx
import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import { Text, View, Button, Platform } from 'react-native';
import * as Device from 'expo-device';
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';
import Constants from 'expo-constants';

Notifications.setNotificationHandler({
  handleNotification: async () => ({
    shouldPlaySound: false,
    shouldSetBadge: false,
    shouldShowBanner: true,
    shouldShowList: true,
  }),
});

export default function App() {
  const [expoPushToken, setExpoPushToken] = useState('');
  const [channels, setChannels] = useState<Notifications.NotificationChannel[]>([]);
  const [notification, setNotification] = useState<Notifications.Notification | undefined>(
    undefined
  );

  useEffect(() => {
    registerForPushNotificationsAsync().then(token => token && setExpoPushToken(token));

    if (Platform.OS === 'android') {
      Notifications.getNotificationChannelsAsync().then(value => setChannels(value ?? []));
    }
    const notificationListener = Notifications.addNotificationReceivedListener(notification => {
      setNotification(notification);
    });

    const responseListener = Notifications.addNotificationResponseReceivedListener(response => {
      console.log(response);
    });

    return () => {
      notificationListener.remove();
      responseListener.remove();
    };
  }, []);

  return (

    </View>
  );
}

async function schedulePushNotification() {
  await Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
    content: {
      title: "You've got mail! 📬",
      body: 'Here is the notification body',
      data: { data: 'goes here', test: { test1: 'more data' } },
    },
    trigger: {
      type: Notifications.SchedulableTriggerInputTypes.TIME_INTERVAL,

      return;
    }
    // Learn more about projectId:

      token = `${e}`;
    }
  } else {
    alert('Must use physical device for Push Notifications');
  }

  return token;
}
```

### Present a local (in-app) notification to the user

```ts
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

// First, set the handler that will cause the notification
// to show the alert
Notifications.setNotificationHandler({
  handleNotification: async () => ({
    shouldPlaySound: false,
    shouldSetBadge: false,
    shouldShowBanner: true,
    shouldShowList: true,
  }),
});

// Second, call scheduleNotificationAsync()
Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
  content: {
    title: 'Look at that notification',
    body: "I'm so proud of myself!",
  },
  trigger: null,
});
```

### Handle push notifications with navigation

If you'd like to deep link to a specific screen in your app when you receive a push notification, you can configure either of Expo's navigation systems to do that.

<Tabs>

<Tab label="Expo Router">

You can use Expo Router's [built-in deep linking](https://docs.expo.dev/router/basics/core-concepts/#2-all-pages-have-a-url) to handle incoming URLs from push notifications. Simply configure the root layout to listen for incoming and initial notification events.

```tsx app/_layout.tsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';
import { router } from 'expo-router';

function useNotificationObserver() {
  useEffect(() => {
    function redirect(notification: Notifications.Notification) {
      const url = notification.request.content.data?.url;
      if (typeof url === 'string') {
        /* @info Push the URL. You may want to verify the format before navigating. */
        router.push(url);
        /* @end */
      }
    }

    /* @info Handle the initial push notification. */
    const response = Notifications.getLastNotificationResponse();
    if (response?.notification) {
      redirect(response.notification);
    }

    /* @info Listen for runtime notifications. */
    const subscription = Notifications.addNotificationResponseReceivedListener(response => {
      /* @end */
      redirect(response.notification);
    });

    return () => {
      subscription.remove();
    };
  }, []);
}

export default function Layout() {
  /* @info Observe at the root. Ensure this layout never returns <b>null</b> or the navigation will go unhandled. */
  useNotificationObserver();
  /* @end */

  return <Slot />;
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab label="React Navigation">

React Navigation's manual [linking configuration](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigation-container#linking) can be configured to handle incoming redirects from push notifications:

```tsx App.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Linking } from 'react-native';
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer
      linking={{
        config: {
          // Configuration for linking
        },
        async getInitialURL() {
          // First, you may want to do the default deep link handling
          // Check if app was opened from a deep link
          const url = await Linking.getInitialURL();

          if (url != null) {
            return url;
          }

          // Handle URL from expo push notifications
          const response = Notifications.getLastNotificationResponse();

          return response?.notification.request.content.data.url;
        },
        subscribe(listener) {
          const onReceiveURL = ({ url }: { url: string }) => listener(url);

          // Listen to incoming links from deep linking
          const eventListenerSubscription = Linking.addEventListener('url', onReceiveURL);

          // Listen to expo push notifications
          const subscription = Notifications.addNotificationResponseReceivedListener(response => {
            const url = response.notification.request.content.data.url;

            // Any custom logic to see whether the URL needs to be handled
            //...

            // Let React Navigation handle the URL
            listener(url);
          });

          return () => {
            // Clean up the event listeners
            eventListenerSubscription.remove();
            subscription.remove();
          };
        },
      }}>
      {/* Your app content */}
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
}
```

## Configuration

### Credentials

Follow the [setup guide](https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/push-notifications-setup/#get-credentials-for-development-builds).

### App config

To configure `expo-notifications`, use the built-in [config plugin](https://docs.expo.dev/config-plugins/introduction/) in the app config (**app.json** or **app.config.js**) for [EAS Build](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction) or with `npx expo run:[android|ios]`. The plugin allows you to configure the following properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect:

### Configurable properties
| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `icon` | - | Only for: android. Local path to an image to use as the icon for push notifications. 96x96 all-white png with transparency. |
| `color` | `#ffffff` | Only for: android. Tint color for the push notification image when it appears in the notification tray. |
| `defaultChannel` | - | Only for: android. Default channel for FCMv1 notifications. |
| `sounds` | - | Array of local paths to sound files (.wav recommended) that can be used as custom notification sounds. Sound will not be played when focus mode does not permit it or silent mode is on. |
| `enableBackgroundRemoteNotifications` | `false` | Only for: ios. Whether to enable background remote notifications, as described in [Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/pushing-background-updates-to-your-app). This updates the `UIBackgroundModes` key in the `Info.plist` to include `remote-notification`. |

Here is an example of using the config plugin in the app config file:

```json app.json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-notifications",
        {
          "icon": "./local/assets/notification_icon.png",
          "color": "#ffffff",
          "defaultChannel": "default",
          "sounds": [
            "./local/assets/notification_sound.wav",
            "./local/assets/notification_sound_other.wav"
          ],
          "enableBackgroundRemoteNotifications": false
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

## Permissions

### Android

- On Android, this module requires permission to subscribe to the device boot. It's used to set up scheduled notifications when the device (re)starts.
  The `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` permission is added automatically through the library's **AndroidManifest.xml**.

- Starting from Android 12 (API level 31), to schedule a notification that triggers at an exact time, you need to add
  `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM"/>` to **AndroidManifest.xml**.
  Read more about the [exact alarm permission](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-12#exact-alarm-permission).

- On Android 13, app users must opt-in to receive notifications via a permissions prompt automatically triggered by the operating system.
  This prompt will not appear until at least one notification channel is created. The `setNotificationChannelAsync` must be called before
  `getDevicePushTokenAsync` or `getExpoPushTokenAsync` to obtain a push token. You can read more about the new notification permission behavior for Android 13
  in the [official documentation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/notifications/notification-permission#new-apps).

<AndroidPermissions permissions={['RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED', 'SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM']} />

### iOS

No usage description is required, see [notification-related permissions](#fetch-information-about-notifications-related-permissions).

### Interpret the iOS permissions response

On iOS, permissions for sending notifications are a little more granular than they are on Android. This is why you should rely on the `NotificationPermissionsStatus`'s `ios.status` field, instead of the root `status` field.

This value will be one of the following, accessible under `Notifications.IosAuthorizationStatus`:

- `NOT_DETERMINED`: The user hasn't yet made a choice about whether the app is allowed to schedule notifications
- `DENIED`: The app isn't authorized to schedule or receive notifications
- `AUTHORIZED`: The app is authorized to schedule or receive notifications
- `PROVISIONAL`: The app is provisionally authorized to post noninterruptive user notifications
- `EPHEMERAL`: The app is authorized to schedule or receive notifications for a limited amount of time

## Notification events listeners

Notification events include incoming notifications, interactions your users perform with notifications (this can be tapping on a notification, or interacting with it via [notification categories](#manage-notification-categories-interactive-notifications)), and rare occasions when your notifications may be dropped.

Several listeners are exposed and documented in the [Push notification behaviors](https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/what-you-need-to-know/#push-notification-behaviors) section.

## Headless (Background) notifications

See the [definition](https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/what-you-need-to-know/#headless-background-notifications) of Headless Background Notifications in the [What you need to know](https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/what-you-need-to-know) guide.

To handle notifications while the app is in the background or not running, you need to do the following:

- Add `expo-task-manager` package to your project.
- [Configure background notifications](#background-notification-configuration).
- In your application code, set up a [background task](#registertaskasynctaskname) to run when the notification is received.

Then send a push notification which:

- Contains only the `data` key (no `title`, `body`)
- Has `_contentAvailable: true` set for iOS &mdash; see the [Expo push notification service payload format](https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/sending-notifications/#message-request-format)

### Background notification configuration&ensp;<PlatformTags platforms={["ios"]} />

To be able to use headless (background) notifications push notifications on iOS, the `remote-notification` value needs to be present in the `UIBackgroundModes` array in your app's **Info.plist** file.

**If you're using [CNG](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/continuous-native-generation/)**, set the [`enableBackgroundRemoteNotifications` property](#configurable-properties) of the config plugin to true, and the correct configuration will be applied automatically by prebuild.

#### Configure UIBackgroundModes manually on iOS

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/continuous-native-generation/)) or you're using a native iOS project, then you'll need to add the following to your **Expo.plist** file:

```xml ios/project-name/Supporting/Expo.plist
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
  <string>remote-notification</string>
</array>
```

## Additional information

### Set custom notification sounds

To add custom push notification sounds to your app, add the `expo-notifications` plugin to your **app.json** file and then under the `sounds` key, provide an array of local paths to sound files that can be used as custom notification sounds. These local paths are local to your project.

```json app.json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-notifications",
        {
          "sounds": ["local/path/to/mySoundFile.wav"]
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

After building your app, the array of files will be available for use in both [`NotificationContentInput`](#notificationcontentinput) and [`NotificationChannelInput`](#notificationchannelinput).
You only need to provide the base filename. Here's an example using the config above:

```ts
await Notifications.setNotificationChannelAsync('new_emails', {
  name: 'E-mail notifications',
  importance: Notifications.AndroidImportance.HIGH,
  sound: 'mySoundFile.wav', // Provide ONLY the base filename
});

await Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
  content: {
    title: "You've got mail! 📬",
    sound: 'mySoundFile.wav', // Provide ONLY the base filename
  },
  trigger: {
    type: Notifications.SchedulableTriggerInputTypes.TIME_INTERVAL,
    seconds: 2,
    channelId: 'new_emails',
  },
});
```

You can also manually add notification files to your Android and iOS projects if you prefer:

#### Manually adding notification sounds on Android

On Androids 8.0+, playing a custom sound for a notification requires more than setting the `sound` property on the `NotificationContentInput`.
You will also need to configure the `NotificationChannel` with the appropriate `sound`, and use it when sending/scheduling the notification.

For the example below to work, you would place your **email_sound.wav** file in **android/app/src/main/res/raw/**.

```ts
// Prepare the notification channel
await Notifications.setNotificationChannelAsync('new_emails', {
  name: 'E-mail notifications',
  importance: Notifications.AndroidImportance.HIGH,
  sound: 'email_sound.wav', // <- for Android 8.0+, see channelId property below
});

// Eg. schedule the notification
await Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
  content: {
    title: "You've got mail! 📬",
    body: 'Open the notification to read them all',
    sound: 'email_sound.wav', // <- for Android below 8.0
  },
  trigger: {
    type: Notifications.SchedulableTriggerInputTypes.TIME_INTERVAL,
    seconds: 2,
    channelId: 'new_emails', // <- for Android 8.0+, see definition above
  },
});
```

#### Manually adding notification sounds on iOS

On iOS, all that's needed is to place your sound file in your Xcode project (see the screenshot below),
and then specify the sound file in your `NotificationContentInput`, like this:

```ts
await Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
  content: {
    title: "You've got mail! 📬",
    body: 'Open the notification to read them all',
    sound: 'notification.wav',
  },
  trigger: {
    // ...
  },
});
```

[notification.wav inside of app resources in Xcode project organizer](https://docs.expo.dev/static/images/notification_sound_ios.jpeg)

### Push notification payload specification

See [Message request format](https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/sending-notifications/#message-request-format).

### Manage notification categories for interactive notifications

Notification categories allow you to create interactive push notifications, so that a user can respond directly to the incoming notification
either via buttons or a text response. A category defines the set of actions a user can take, and then those actions are applied to a notification
by specifying the `categoryIdentifier` in the [`NotificationContent`](#notificationcontent).

<ContentSpotlight
  src="/static/images/sdk/notifications/categories.png"
  className="max-w-[800px]"
  alt="Image of notification categories on Android and iOS"
/>

On iOS, notification categories also allow you to customize your notifications further. With each category, not only can you set interactive actions a user can take, but you can also configure things like the placeholder text to display when the user disables notification previews for your app.

## Platform-specific guides

### Handling notification channels&ensp;<PlatformTags platforms={['android 8+']} />

Starting in Android 8.0 (API level 26), all notifications must be assigned to a channel. For each channel,
you can set the visual and auditory behavior that is applied to all notifications in that channel.
Then, users can change these settings and decide which notification channels from your app should be intrusive or visible at all,
as [Android developer docs](https://developer.android.com/training/notify-user/channels) states.

If you do not specify a notification channel, `expo-notifications` will create a fallback channel for you, named **Miscellaneous**.
We encourage you to always ensure appropriate channels with informative names are set up for the application and to always send notifications to these channels.

> Calling these methods is a no-op for platforms that do not support this feature (Android below version 8.0 (26) and iOS).

### Custom notification icon and colors&ensp;<PlatformTags platforms={['android']} />

You can configure the `icon` and `color` keys for notification in the project by using the [`expo-notifications` config plugin](#configurable-properties) with [Expo Prebuild](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/prebuild). These are build-time settings, so you'll need to recompile your native Android app with `eas build -p android` or `npx expo run:android` to see the changes.

For your notification icon, make sure you follow [Google's design guidelines](https://material.io/design/iconography/product-icons.html#design-principles)
(the icon must be all white with a transparent background) or else it may not be displayed as intended.

You can also set a custom notification color **per-notification** directly in your [`NotificationContentInput`](#notificationcontentinput) under the `color` attribute.

## API

```js
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';
```

## API: expo-notifications

### Fetch tokens for push notifications

#### getDevicePushTokenAsync (*Function*)
- `getDevicePushTokenAsync(): Promise<DevicePushToken>`
  Returns a native FCM, APNs token or a [`PushSubscription` data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushSubscription)
  that can be used with another push notification service.

#### getExpoPushTokenAsync (*Function*)
- `getExpoPushTokenAsync(options: ExpoPushTokenOptions): Promise<ExpoPushToken>`
  Returns an Expo token that can be used to send a push notification to the device using Expo's push notifications service.

  This method makes requests to the Expo's servers. It can get rejected in cases where the request itself fails
  (for example, due to the device being offline, experiencing a network timeout, or other HTTPS request failures).
  To provide offline support to your users, you should `try/catch` this method and implement retry logic to attempt
  to get the push token later, once the device is back online.

  > For Expo's backend to be able to send notifications to your app, you will need to provide it with push notification keys.
  For more information, see [credentials](https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/push-notifications-setup/#get-credentials-for-development-builds) in the push notifications setup.
  | Parameter | Type | Description |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `options` | ExpoPushTokenOptions | Object allowing you to pass in push notification configuration. |
  Returns: Returns a `Promise` that resolves to an object representing acquired push token.
  Example:
  ```ts
  import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

  export async function registerForPushNotificationsAsync(userId: string) {
    const expoPushToken = await Notifications.getExpoPushTokenAsync({
     projectId: 'your-project-id',
    });

    await fetch('https://example.com/', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {

### Present incoming notifications when the app is running

#### setNotificationHandler (*Function*)
- `setNotificationHandler(handler: null | NotificationHandler)`
  When a notification is received while the app is running, using this function you can set a callback that will decide
  whether the notification should be shown to the user or not.

  When a notification is received, `handleNotification` is called with the incoming notification as an argument.
  The function should respond with a behavior object within 3 seconds, otherwise, the notification will be discarded.
  If the notification is handled successfully, `handleSuccess` is called with the identifier of the notification,
  otherwise (or on timeout) `handleError` will be called.

  The default behavior when the handler is not set or does not respond in time is not to show the notification.
  | Parameter | Type | Description |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `handler` | null \| NotificationHandler | A single parameter which should be either `null` (if you want to clear the handler) or a [`NotificationHandler`](#notificationhandler) object. |
  Example:
  ```jsx
  import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

  Notifications.setNotificationHandler({
    handleNotification: async () => ({
      shouldShowBanner: true,
      shouldShowList: true,
      shouldPlaySound: false,
      shouldSetBadge: false,
    }),
  });
  ```

### Run JavaScript in response to incoming notifications

#### registerTaskAsync (*Function*)
- `registerTaskAsync(taskName: string): Promise<null>`
  Call `registerTaskAsync` to set a callback (task) that runs when a notification is received while the app is in foreground, background, or terminated.
  Only on Android, the task also runs in response to a notification action press when the app is backgrounded or terminated.
  When the app is terminated, only a [Headless Background Notification](https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/what-you-need-to-know/#headless-background-notifications) triggers the task execution.
  However, the OS may decide not to deliver the notification to your app in some cases (e.g. when the device is in Doze mode on Android, or when you send too many notifications - Apple recommends to not ["send more than two or three per hour"](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/pushing-background-updates-to-your-app#overview)).

  Under the hood, this function is run using `expo-task-manager`. You **must** define the task first, with [`TaskManager.defineTask`](./task-manager#taskmanagerdefinetasktaskname-taskexecutor) and register it with `registerTaskAsync`.

  Make sure you define and register the task in the module scope of a JS module which is required early by your app (e.g. in the `index.js` file).
  `expo-task-manager` loads your app's JS bundle in the background and executes the task, as well as any side effects which may happen as a consequence of requiring any JS modules.

  The callback function you define with `TaskManager.defineTask` receives an object with the following fields:
  - `data`: The remote payload delivered by either FCM (Android) or APNs (iOS). See [`NotificationTaskPayload`](#notificationtaskpayload) for details.
  - `error`: The error (if any) that occurred during execution of the task.
  - `executionInfo`: JSON object of additional info related to the task, including the `taskName`.
  | Parameter | Type | Description |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `taskName` | string | The string you passed to `TaskManager.defineTask` as the `taskName` parameter. |
  Example:
  ```ts
  import * as TaskManager from 'expo-task-manager';
  import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

  const BACKGROUND_NOTIFICATION_TASK = 'BACKGROUND-NOTIFICATION-TASK';

  TaskManager.defineTask<Notifications.NotificationTaskPayload>(BACKGROUND_NOTIFICATION_TASK, ({ data, error, executionInfo }) => {
    console.log('Received a notification task payload!');
    const isNotificationResponse = 'actionIdentifier' in data;
    if (isNotificationResponse) {
      // Do something with the notification response from user
    } else {
      // Do something with the data from notification that was received
    }
  });

  Notifications.registerTaskAsync(BACKGROUND_NOTIFICATION_TASK);
  ```

#### unregisterTaskAsync (*Function*)
- `unregisterTaskAsync(taskName: string): Promise<null>`
  Used to unregister tasks registered with `registerTaskAsync` method.
  | Parameter | Type | Description |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `taskName` | string | The string you passed to `registerTaskAsync` as the `taskName` parameter. |

### Fetch information about notifications-related permissions

#### getPermissionsAsync (*Function*)
- `getPermissionsAsync(): Promise<NotificationPermissionsStatus>`
  Calling this function checks current permissions settings related to notifications.
  It lets you verify whether the app is currently allowed to display alerts, play sounds, etc.
  There is no user-facing effect of calling this.
  Returns: It returns a `Promise` resolving to an object represents permission settings ([`NotificationPermissionsStatus`](#notificationpermissionsstatus)).
  On iOS, make sure you [properly interpret the permissions response](#interpret-the-ios-permissions-response).
  Example:
  ```ts
  import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

  export async function allowsNotificationsAsync() {
    const settings = await Notifications.getPermissionsAsync();
    return (
      settings.granted || settings.ios?.status === Notifications.IosAuthorizationStatus.PROVISIONAL
    );
  }
  ```

#### requestPermissionsAsync (*Function*)
- `requestPermissionsAsync(permissions?: NotificationPermissionsRequest): Promise<NotificationPermissionsStatus>`
  Prompts the user for notification permissions according to request. **Request defaults to asking the user to allow displaying alerts,
  setting badge count and playing sounds**.
  | Parameter | Type | Description |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `permissions` *(optional)* | NotificationPermissionsRequest | An object representing configuration for the request scope. |
  Returns: It returns a Promise resolving to an object represents permission settings ([`NotificationPermissionsStatus`](#notificationpermissionsstatus)).
  On iOS, make sure you [properly interpret the permissions response](#interpret-the-ios-permissions-response).
  Example:
  ```ts
  import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

  export function requestPermissionsAsync() {
    return Notifications.requestPermissionsAsync({
      ios: {
        allowAlert: true,
        allowBadge: true,
        allowSound: true,
      },
    });
  }
  ```

### Manage application badge icon

#### getBadgeCountAsync (*Function*)
- `getBadgeCountAsync(): Promise<number>`

  > **Note:** Not all Android launchers support application badges. If the launcher does not support icon badges, the method will always resolve to `0`.
  Returns: Returns a Promise resolving to a number that represents the current badge of the app icon.

#### setBadgeCountAsync (*Function*)
- `setBadgeCountAsync(badgeCount: number, options?: SetBadgeCountOptions): Promise<boolean>`
  Sets the badge of the app's icon to the specified number. Setting it to `0` clears the badge. On iOS, this method requires that you have requested
  the user's permission for `allowBadge` via [`requestPermissionsAsync`](#requestpermissionsasyncpermissions),
  otherwise it will automatically return `false`.
  > **Note:** Not all Android launchers support application badges. If the launcher does not support icon badges, the method will resolve to `false`.
  | Parameter | Type | Description |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `badgeCount` | number | The count which should appear on the badge. A value of `0` will clear the badge. |
  | `options` *(optional)* | SetBadgeCountOptions | An object of options configuring behavior applied. |

  export default function App() {
    React.useEffect(() => {
      const subscription = Notifications.addNotificationReceivedListener(notification => {
        console.log(notification);
      });
      return () => subscription.remove();

#### PushTokenListener (*Type*)
A function accepting a device push token ([`DevicePushToken`](#devicepushtoken)) as an argument.
> **Note:** You should not call `getDevicePushTokenAsync` inside this function, as it triggers the listener and may lead to an infinite loop.
Type: (token: DevicePushToken) => void

#### RequiredBy (*Type*)
Type: Partial<Omit<T, K>> & Required<Pick<T, K>>

#### SchedulableNotificationTriggerInput (*Type*)
Input for time-based, schedulable triggers.
For these triggers you can check the next trigger date with [`getNextTriggerDateAsync`](#getnexttriggerdateasynctrigger).
If you pass in a `number` (Unix timestamp) or `Date`, it will be processed as a
trigger input of type [`SchedulableTriggerInputTypes.DATE`](#date). Otherwise, the input must be
an object, with a `type` value set to one of the allowed values in [`SchedulableTriggerInputTypes`](#schedulabletriggerinputtypes).
If the input is an object, date components passed in will be validated, and
an error is thrown if they are outside their allowed range (for example, the `minute` and
`second` components must be between 0 and 59 inclusive).
Type: CalendarTriggerInput | TimeIntervalTriggerInput | DailyTriggerInput | WeeklyTriggerInput | MonthlyTriggerInput | YearlyTriggerInput | DateTriggerInput

#### Subscription (*Type*)
Type: EventSubscription

#### TimeIntervalTriggerInput (*Type*)
This trigger input will cause the notification to be delivered once or many times
