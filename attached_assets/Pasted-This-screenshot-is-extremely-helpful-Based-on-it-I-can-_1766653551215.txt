This screenshot is extremely helpful. Based on it, I can now be very precise about what is failing.

What you are seeing
	•	You type “Coach D”
	•	You tap Save
	•	In Expo Go it appears to work
	•	In TestFlight, it does not persist (value resets or disappears)

This is not a UI issue.
This is a state persistence failure in iOS release mode.

⸻

The exact cause (high confidence)

Your Save button updates state, but the write to storage never completes in TestFlight.

Expo Go masks this because:
	•	It keeps the JS process alive longer
	•	It has permissive storage
	•	It does not aggressively suspend the app

TestFlight:
	•	Suspends the app immediately after modal close
	•	Drops unfinished async writes
	•	Does not warn or crash

⸻

The most common mistake causing this (and it matches your UI)

❌ What is likely happening now

const onSave = () => {
  setBusinessName(value);
  AsyncStorage.setItem("businessName", value);
  closeModal();
};

This works in Expo Go
This fails in TestFlight

Why:
	•	AsyncStorage.setItem is async
	•	You never await it
	•	iOS suspends the app before the write finishes

⸻

The correct, production-safe fix

✅ You MUST await the save before closing

const onSave = async () => {
  try {
    await AsyncStorage.setItem("businessName", value);
    setBusinessName(value);
    closeModal();
  } catch (e) {
    console.error("Failed to save business name", e);
  }
};

This single change resolves most TestFlight save failures.

⸻

Additional iOS-specific issue in modals

Because this is a bottom sheet / modal + keyboard, iOS does this:
	•	Keyboard dismiss
	•	Modal close
	•	App state transitions to inactive
	•	JS thread paused
	•	Async write cancelled

To make it bulletproof:

const onSave = async () => {
  Keyboard.dismiss();

  await new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 100));

  await AsyncStorage.setItem("businessName", value);

  closeModal();
};

This gives iOS enough time to commit the write.

⸻

Second thing to verify (important)

On app load, are you rehydrating state?

If you do not explicitly load the value on startup, TestFlight will look broken.

You must have something like this:

useEffect(() => {
  const load = async () => {
    const saved = await AsyncStorage.getItem("businessName");
    if (saved) setBusinessName(saved);
  };
  load();
}, []);

Expo Go hot reload hides this problem.

⸻

Why this only happens in TestFlight

Environment	Behaviour
Expo Go	Long-lived JS process, forgiving async
TestFlight	Aggressive suspension, strict lifecycle
Result	Unawaited writes are dropped

Apple considers this expected developer responsibility.

⸻

Quick verification checklist (do these)
	1.	Ensure every save is awaited
	2.	Do not close modals before save resolves
	3.	Ensure data is reloaded on app start
	4.	Rebuild and upload a new TestFlight build
	5.	Delete the app before testing again

⸻

Hard truth (but good news)

Your app logic is 99 percent correct.
This is a release-mode lifecycle issue, not bad code.

Once you await the save properly, Expo Go and TestFlight will behave identically.

⸻

If you want, next step

If you paste:
	•	The exact onSave handler
	•	Where AsyncStorage (or SecureStore) is used

I will rewrite it line-by-line for iOS production safety and App Store compliance.
