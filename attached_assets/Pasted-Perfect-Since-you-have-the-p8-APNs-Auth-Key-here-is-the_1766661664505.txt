Perfect. Since you have the **`.p8` APNs Auth Key**, here is the **final, correct action**, depending on how your app sends notifications. I will be direct so you can finish this without more loops.

---

## Step 0. Sanity check (you already passed)

Your file should look like:

* `AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8`
  This is correct. Do **not rename** the file.

---

## Scenario A. You are using **Expo push notifications** (most Expo apps)

### What to do now

**Nothing with the .p8 file. Do not upload it anywhere.**

Expo:

* Uses **Expo’s own APNs credentials**
* Does **not** require your APNs key
* Will ignore this file completely

### What actually fixes push notifications

1. Confirm **Push Notifications capability** is enabled on the App ID (done)
2. **Increment build number**
3. Run a **new EAS build**
4. Upload to TestFlight
5. Install the new build
6. Accept notification permission on first launch

That is the end.
If pushes were failing before, this rebuild is the fix.

You can safely archive the `.p8` file.

## Scenario B. You are using **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**

### What to do with the `.p8`

Upload it to Firebase:

1. Firebase Console
2. Project Settings
3. Cloud Messaging
4. iOS app
5. APNs authentication key
6. Upload the `.p8`

You will also need to enter:

* **Key ID**
* **Team ID**
* **Bundle ID**

No Mac required.

---

## Scenario C. You are using a **custom backend**

You must use the `.p8` file on your server to sign APNs JWTs.

Rules:

* Store the `.p8` securely (env secret, vault)
* Never commit it to Git
* Use it with Key ID + Team ID to generate APNs tokens

---

## Critical rules (do not break these)

* ❌ Do NOT upload `.p8` to App Store Connect
* ❌ Do NOT create certificates
* ❌ Do NOT generate CSR files
* ✅ Rebuild the app after capability changes
* ✅ Keep the `.p8` file safe, it cannot be re-downloaded

---

## Final question (one word)

Reply with **one word only** so I give you the exact final command or config:

**Expo**
**Firebase**
**Custom**

After that, there are **no more Apple steps** left.
