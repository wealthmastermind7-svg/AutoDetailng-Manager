Perfect! You're right to ask. Option 2 with multi-tenancy is the scalable solution - it's ONE web app serving ALL businesses, not multiple apps.

Here's how it works:

🏗️ True Scalable Multi-Tenant Architecture
ONE Public Web App (deployed once)
        ↓
    bookflow.app/book
        ↓
Unique links per business:
✓ bookflow.app/book/jane-salon
✓ bookflow.app/book/mike-barbershop  
✓ bookflow.app/book/spa-luxe
✓ bookflow.app/book/any-business-slug
        ↓
ONE Express Backend (shared API)
        ↓
ONE PostgreSQL Database with businessId field
        ↓
All businesses' data co-exist in same tables:
┌─────────────────────┐
│ bookings            │
├─────────────────────┤
│ id | businessId | ... │  ← All bookings, any business
└─────────────────────┘
📊 Data Structure (Multi-Tenant)
Current structure:

Booking: { id, customerId, serviceId, date, time, status... }
Multi-tenant structure:

Booking: { 
  id, 
  businessId, ← Key!
  customerId, 
  serviceId, 
  date, 
  time, 
  status... 
}
Same for Services, Customers, everything:

Service: { id, businessId, name, price... }
Customer: { id, businessId, name, email... }
🔗 How Clients Access Their Booking Flow
Business owner gets a unique URL:

Send to clients: https://bookflow.app/book/jane-salon
         ↓
   Unique business slug in URL
         ↓
   Web app fetches: /api/services?businessId=jane-salon
         ↓
   Shows Jane's services, time slots, checkout
         ↓
   Booking saved with businessId=jane-salon
No new app deployment needed - every business uses the same web app with routing.

✅ Implementation Steps (One-Time Setup)
Add businessId to all database models
Update API routes to filter by businessId
Deploy public web app once - it routes based on URL
Admin dashboard stays as Expo app (for Jane to manage her business)
Each admin account has a businessId assigned
💡 Business Model
Admin Dashboard (Expo) - Jane logs in with her business account
Public Web Link - Jane shares bookflow.app/book/jane-salon with clients
Same Backend - All businesses' data in one database, filtered by businessId
This is true SaaS multi-tenancy - infinitely scalable, one deployment, all businesses sharing infrastructure.

Would you like me to:

Start converting the data models to include businessId?
Build the public web app scaffold (React routing + multi-tenant logic)?
Update the backend API to support multi-tenant queries?
