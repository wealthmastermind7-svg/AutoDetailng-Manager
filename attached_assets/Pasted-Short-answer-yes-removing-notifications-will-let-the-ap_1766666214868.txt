Short answer: yes, removing notifications will let the app function, but no, creating a new app is not necessary. Here is the precise guidance so you can decide correctly.

⸻

1. Will removing notifications make the app work?

Yes.
If push notifications are currently misconfigured, they can block or break runtime behavior, especially in TestFlight, if your code assumes notification permissions, tokens, or listeners exist.

If you:
	•	Remove push notification code, and
	•	Remove notification permissions and listeners,

then:
	•	The app will launch normally
	•	Core functionality will work
	•	App Store review will be simpler
	•	You eliminate an entire failure surface

This is a valid and common strategy for first release.

⸻

2. Should you create a new app?

No. Absolutely not.

Creating a new app:
	•	Resets App Store history
	•	Loses bundle ID continuity
	•	Wastes the setup you already completed
	•	Does not solve notification issues (they will reappear)

Everything you are facing is configuration-level, not app-level.

⸻

3. Recommended decision matrix

Option A. Remove notifications for now (RECOMMENDED)

Best if:
	•	Notifications are not core to your value proposition
	•	You want to ship fast
	•	You want fewer App Store review risks

What to do:
	•	Remove notification-related code
	•	Remove notification permission request
	•	Rebuild and resubmit

You can add notifications back later in an update.

Apple does not penalize this.

⸻

Option B. Keep notifications and rebuild

Best if:
	•	Notifications are core (reminders, alerts, tracking)
	•	You are comfortable rebuilding once more

What to do:
	•	Keep notification code
	•	Ensure Push Notifications capability is enabled
	•	Rebuild and resubmit

This also works, but requires patience.

⸻

Option C. New app

❌ Not recommended
Only useful if:
	•	Bundle ID is irreparably wrong
	•	App identity is fundamentally changing

None of those apply here.

⸻

4. What Apple actually cares about

Apple does not require push notifications.

They only care that:
	•	If you request notification permission, it must be justified
	•	The app must not crash if permission is denied
	•	The app must function without notifications

Removing notifications reduces scrutiny, not increases it.

⸻

5. My direct recommendation for you

Given your situation and how close you are:

👉 Remove notifications for now, ship the app, add them back in v1.1

This is how many successful apps ship.

⸻

If you want, I can do one of these next:
	•	Tell you exactly what to remove in your Expo / React Native code
	•	Confirm whether notifications are actually breaking anything
	•	Help you add notifications back later cleanly, without redoing Apple setup

Just tell me which path you want to take.
