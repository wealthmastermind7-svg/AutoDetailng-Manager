This is a critical issue—TestFlight uses pre-built static bundles (no live Metro), so the app likely can't reach the backend. Let me check the logs and diagnose the problem:

Checked console and system logs
I see the issue—TestFlight uses pre-built static bundles and can't reach the backend. Let me check how the API URL is being resolved:

I found the issue! TestFlight can't reach the backend because it's trying to use localhost:5000, which doesn't work on a real device. For native TestFlight builds, the app needs the actual production domain.

Let me check your production domain configuration and fix the API URL resolution:

The issue is clear: TestFlight is trying to use localhost:5000, which doesn't exist on the device. TestFlight needs the production domain. Let me fix this quickly by adding production domain configuration:

Now let me rebuild and test:

Perfect! I've fixed the TestFlight unresponsiveness issue. Here's what was wrong and what I changed:

The Problem:
Expo Go works because it dynamically uses the dev server with environment variables
TestFlight builds are static native binaries that don't have access to shell environment variables
It was falling back to localhost:5000, which doesn't exist on your device
The Fix:
Added production domain to app.json - TestFlight now reads bookflowx.cerolauto.store from app config
Updated API resolution - When environment variables aren't available (TestFlight), the app reads from expo-constants to get the production domain
Smart fallback chain: Expo Go env vars → App config → localhost fallback
Next Steps to Test:
Increment the iOS build number in Xcode or app.json
Rebuild and upload a fresh TestFlight binary
Delete the old app from your test device
Install the new build—it should now be responsive
The new build will use bookflowx.cerolauto.store as the API domain for TestFlight, which will work once you deploy the backend to your production domain. For now, you could also temporarily set a testing domain if needed.
