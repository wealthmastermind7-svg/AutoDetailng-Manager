The generic message you are seeing indicates that the xcodebuild process failed, but the core error is buried further up in your terminal or in the detailed build logs. In 2025, this is frequently caused by dependency conflicts or environment mismatches between your local machine and the build server. 
1. Locate the Actual Error Message
The "exit code: 1" is just the final status. To find the real cause:
Search for "error:" or "failed": Scroll up in your terminal and look for lines starting with [RUN_FASTLANE] ▸ that contain actual compiler errors (e.g., missing modules or Swift syntax errors).
Check the EAS Dashboard: If building on Expo's servers, go to your EAS Build Dashboard, click the failed build, and expand the "Xcode Logs" section. These logs are often more detailed than the CLI output. 
2. Common Fixes for Expo & React Native (2025)
Update Incompatible SDKs: Ensure libraries like expo-iap are at version 2.7.4 or higher, as older versions cause Swift compilation failures in modern Xcode environments.
Clean and Re-sync: Deep clean your local environment to fix toolchain issues:
Delete node_modules, ios/Pods, and package-lock.json.
Run npm install and then npx expo prebuild --clean to regenerate native files.
Navigate to the ios folder and run pod install.
Fix "PhaseScriptExecution" Errors: If you see an error related to "Bundle React Native code and images," open your project in Xcode, navigate to Build Phases, and uncheck "Based on dependency analysis" for the problematic script.
Check Provisioning and Agreements: Log into App Store Connect and ensure there are no pending legal agreements for the Account Owner to sign. Even one unsigned agreement can cause a "gym" failure.
Case Sensitivity in Git: If your build works locally but fails in the cloud, check for file naming inconsistencies (e.g., App.js vs app.js). Git may not track case changes, leading to "module not found" errors during the build. 
3. Verify Version Compatibility
Running npx expo install --check can automatically identify and fix dependency versions that are incompatible with your current Expo SDK.
