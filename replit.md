## User Preferences
- **Communication Style**: I prefer clear, concise, and direct communication.
- **Explanation Style**: Provide detailed explanations for complex concepts or decisions.
- **Workflow**: I prefer an iterative development approach.
- **Interaction**: Ask before making major architectural changes or introducing new dependencies.
- **Codebase Changes**:
    - Do not change the fundamental premium black & white color scheme.
    - Prioritize robust error handling and graceful fallbacks.
    - Ensure new features integrate seamlessly with existing haptic feedback patterns.
    - When updating dependencies, prioritize stability and production readiness.

## System Architecture
AutoDetailing Manager utilizes a decoupled frontend and backend architecture.

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Color Palette**: Premium black & white (`Pure Black`, `Charcoal`, `Graphite`, `Smoke`, `Silver`, `Pearl`).
- **Typography**: Oversized hierarchy (`Display 72-96px`, `H1 48-56px`, `Body 18-24px`).
- **Animation**: Spring physics with cinematic transitions (400ms ease-out).
- **Components**: Custom Circular Meters, Animated Cards, and Line Graphs with Bezier curves.
- **Haptic Feedback**: Comprehensive haptic feedback (Light, Medium, Heavy) on all interactive elements.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: React Native (Expo) for cross-platform mobile and web, featuring a 5-tab admin dashboard and public booking flow. API communication is managed via `client/lib/api.ts` with resilient environment detection.
- **Backend**: Express.js server providing a multi-tenant REST API, using Drizzle ORM for PostgreSQL.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with a multi-tenant schema for `businesses`, `services`, `customers`, `bookings`, `availability`, and `pushTokens`.
- **Navigation**: `MainTabNavigator` for admin and `BookingFlowNavigator` for public access.

### Feature Specifications
- **Dashboard**: Revenue metrics and booking graphs, with a toggle for "This Week" (top 3) or "All" upcoming bookings.
- **Management**: CRUD for services and customer listings.
- **Public Booking Flow**: A 4-screen process (Service → Time → Checkout → Confirmation) accessible via unique business slugs.
- **Demo Data**: Multi-business-type demo data (5 verticals).
- **Utilities**: QR Code Generation for booking links and an embeddable booking widget (Calendly-style).

### System Design Choices
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Implemented at API and database levels for data isolation.
- **API Connectivity**: `getApiUrl()` handles dynamic environment detection for development and production.
- **Error Handling**: Client-side retry logic and server-side checks.
- **Production Readiness**: Focus on core features with iOS-specific lifecycle handling for data persistence.
- **Multi-Tenant Security**: Token-based ownership verification (`ownerToken`) for admin routes, ensuring data isolation and preventing cross-tenant access. Public routes remain open.

## External Dependencies
- **React Native (Expo)**: Frontend framework.
- **Express.js**: Backend web framework.
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database.
- **Drizzle ORM**: Database ORM.
- **RevenueCat**: In-app purchase & subscription management.
